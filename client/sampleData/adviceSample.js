      'GraphQL APIs are organized in terms of types and fields, not endpoints. Access the full capabilities of your data from a single endpoint. GraphQL uses types to ensure Apps only ask for whatâ€™s possible and provide clear and helpful errors. Apps can use types to avoid writing manual parsing code.',
    //! need to add this property in the object with the example query call as a regular string template
    Example: `query {
        people

        skin_color,
